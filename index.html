              <h1 align="left"> Would it really affect me if a few things blew up in space?</h1>
                            <p align= "left"> In 2011, the National Research Council in the US published a report stating that we are long past the tipping point when it came to space junk. The reason people are not panicking is because it is truly an invisible problem and it is because we haven’t had a catastrophe yet, and the sad thing is that we will not realise it till it has already happened.<br>
                  Lisa Rand Ruth, a space historian and expert on orbital debris said: “The question to ask yourself is ‘Have I used a satellite today?’ It is only once it starts failing that we start taking notice.”
Satellites are not only pieces of technology; they are infrastructure too. They are what provide a backbone to today’s society run by technology.
“It will be chaos on the ground,” Lisa explained, “We rely on them for everything from social media to GPS, to weather and even ATM withdrawals. Agricultural planning, weather and defence will
be amongst sectors that will be hit the heaviest.”
Without this infrastructure, our airports are lost, so say goodbye to your next tropical vacation.<br>
Lisa also pointed out that if our satellites fall out, it wouldn’t be chaos right away. Things would just stop working. And unlike electric grids that can be repaired in a matter of hours,
it would take months to get the lost satellite services back and running.<br>
To add to the problem, space technologies such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic are enabling us to advance at an exponential rate. A company called One World, funded by the likes of Boeing and Richard Branson are planning to bring internet to the entire planet. While that is a noble objective in itself, they plan to beam all that information into space using a constellation of hundreds of satellites. This excitement over innovation doesn’t bode well for us because we are basically doing with space exactly what we have done with Earth.<br>
The Kessler syndrome as described by Donald J Kessler in 1978 predicts that there will be a reaction that will make collisions very common and create tinier and less trackable pieces of space debris.
If the chain reaction as predicted by the Kessler Syndrome ever found itself to be reality, we could find ourselves trapped in an atmosphere that we could not leave till we found a way to clear that
out of the atmosphere.<br>
  <img align= "right" src="assets/img/work-alex-nowak.jpg">
Inter-agency space debris coordination committee and have tried to develop guidelines to limit space junk. There are no internationally binding laws on space debris. All there is,
is an incentive to behave correctly. What we have on our hands is a tragedy of the commons.<br>
The space environment has ways in which it naturally cleans itself just like a river. During a solar Maximus, every 11 years the solar cycle increases the amount of energy released by the
sun to the earth this heat expands the lower atmosphere which expands and creates a form of air drag which causes the debris to slow down and fall back to the earth, causing it to burn up.
 A process called orbital decay occurs due to gravitational forces, which drags pieces of space junk closer into the atmosphere. <br>
 Our ingenuity reassures that we would be able to solve the problem if it really came down to it, but would it not make sense for us to find a solution to this
 problem before our systems fail and Kessler syndrome actually became reality.</p>

                  <p align= "left">Prof. Hanasoge Mukunda is an advisor at the Indian Institute of Science in India, who has worked in rocket propulsion systems for the last two decades.
                     He said: “Everything in space is debris when it becomes non-functional.<br>
"The end of life (EOL) of a satellite usually occurs because the satellites have no fuel left and this typically occurs about 10 to 12 years after its launch. It is at this (EOL) stage that they become debris.
Sometimes they tumble and slowly come to lower and lower orbits and at some time during this process, they re-enter the earth and burn up.
Additionally, following each stage of the rocket launch, the associated hardware pertaining to that stage also gets separated. These elements also become debris.”<br>
Space usually starts from an altitude of 100 km. The common low earth satellites occupy a region close to 200 km.
Out of the 6,000 satellites launched till date, nearly 4,000 are still in orbit, with only 30 percent of the satellites still classified as operational.
 But what about the other 70 percent? you ask.  They are still up there, zooming in orbits around the earth at speeds of almost 27,000 to 35,000 kilometres per hour.<br>
The Space Surveillance Network, The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) continuously track around 22,000 objects
to predict possible collisions. If an impact is predicted, they alert NASA which then manoeuvres its satellites and the International Space Station out of the debris’ range.
Even a 1% chance is too much of a risk to take. <br>
<img align="left" src="assets\img\work-metiew-smith.jpg" alt="space" hspace="05">
Such correction manoeuvres are an option only for satellites with fuel to spare. Nothing can be done for debris or satellites without them.
In 2009, a dead Russian probe struck and destroyed a US commercial communications satellite, creating about 2000 more pieces of space debris.
A majority of this debris, over 300 million objects - ranging between a few millimetres to a few metres highest concentration of debris — over 300 million objects with diameters ranging from a few millimetres up to several meters — are in orbit between 200 to a 1,000 kilometres. This is the same area that all space programmes need to pass every time they need to reach space.
The current thinking is that micro debris can’t be prevented so the solution is to have the vehicles to be programmed to prevent themselves from crashing into each other to create more space junk.<br>
Passive and active devices can be installed on satellites to remove them at the end of their missions. Some envision an active debris removal (ADR) mission to go grab a dead satellite and remove it.
There are even studies for refurbishing missions, where a robotic space vehicle would grab a satellite nearing its end of life to refuel and service it. Nearly all of these plans are real only on paper.
In 2013, NASA claimed to aim to mitigate the problem because there was no way to practically remove the debris from space.<br>
The problem is that there is no responsibility internationally as there is no clear law on the subject
Another major hurdle is that remediation technologies and operations that look like and could double as antisatellite (ASAT) systems.
Advances in robotics, satellite bus design, automated rendezvous and docking, and low-mass orbital maneuvering systems,
coupled with a variety of efforts to reduce launch costs, may make debris remediation practical in the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
